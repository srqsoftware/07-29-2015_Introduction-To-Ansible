# 07-29-2015 Introduction To Ansible

Ansible is a lightweight powerful tool which can manage the configuration, run maintenance, or even deploy apps on one or thousands of unix servers. 
The only requirements are SSH and python. 
This presentation will take you through the basics of setting up a configuration file called a playbook, managing server settings, and even deploying and updating your app.
