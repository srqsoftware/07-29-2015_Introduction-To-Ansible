# 07-29-2015 Introduction To Ansible

Ansible is a lightweight powerful tool which can manage the configuration, run maintenance, or even deploy apps on one or thousands of unix servers. 
The only requirements are SSH and python. 
This presentation will take you through the basics of setting up a configuration file called a playbook, managing server settings, and even deploying and updating your app.

Great resources for learning more about ansible:

Read the docs, they are amazing, and they cover every core module.

Justin Weissig did an excellent video series on ansible you can view here:

People asked about my terminal and vim settings. They are in my dotfiles here. https://github.com/astambrosky/dotfiles
